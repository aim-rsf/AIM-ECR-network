# Coding lists for MLTC
## Speaker - Evelina Gabasova
* **Details:** Studying multiple long term conditions is made difficult by highly variable condition lists across studies. This makes comparing results very difficult, but there are good reasons to develop custom lists based on the aim of different studies. In the session, we will discuss why there are so many different definitions and what can be done to improve the situation.

    - why is there so much variability? are there good reasons, good reasons for consensus lists?
    - Reason discussion for collaborative paper about why are different lists of conditions used, why variability? 
    - Save the date on 23 April 10:00 - 12:00, paper workshop
- MO - team workin on conditions - originally defined as polypharmacy, 2 or more or 4 or more conditions.
    - CPRD data (60 million patients) - won't give everything, not all data that shows 2 or more conditions. So definition based on medications - 4 or more. 
    - Medication criteria - had a lot of back and forth between team and cprd. anyone with 4 or more medications at any point in time. 
    - Data (that we have access to sometime) can restrict how you can define the MLTC
- DynAirx (Hattie) still don't have access to CPRD because the original application was very broad
- OPTIMLA used The Delphi method to decide who/which conditionc to include or exclude
- what is a condition is? how to define it?
    - discussion in their group - like hypertension and diabetes
    - Emma mentioned that 35 code is used for COVID, even the hospital change their code for COVID.
- How you define polypharmcy?
    - In DynAIRx, it was easier when applied to access CPRD data. 
- AA (AI-MULTIPLY) - literature review clinical search of conditions and also a panel with clinicians. 204 defined conditions. 
    - Operationalisation of multimorbidity: https://github.com/Fabiola-Eto/MULTIPLY-Initiative/blob/main/METHODS.md
    - https://github.com/Fabiola-Eto/MULTIPLY-Initiative/blob/main/multimorbidity_list.md

Mohamed Usman - compared code lists of MLTC - OPTIMAL
Claire McKray
- Hattie mentioned that if you're comparing like a definition earlier on in the timeline of multimorbidity interest compared to later when there's more known about it - not sure if they're actually entirely comparable. So, it hard to compare accross papers
    - This could be an issue with transparency in publications
- OPTIMAL code list
    - https://github.com/THINKINGGroup/phenotypes/tree/main/Medical%20conditions
    - https://github.com/THINKINGGroup/phenotypes/tree/main/Medical%20conditions
- Some mental conditions are less defined which makes it hard to include
- Alisha mentioned that sometime you look at ICD codes and prescription codes which can be uses to define painful conditions and concentrations which are not well defined in these other read and ICD codes
- NHS service provision must be affecting how well things are coded

Summary EG
* even if wanted to start with def of 2 or more conditions: 
    * there isn't a defined list of conditions

### From zoom chat:
- I thought 10 or more was for complex polypharmacy? i.e. prioritising the higher risk patients.. but may be remembering wrong!
- Guthrie et al use 5 or more ('rising tide of polypharmacy' paper), and in our research group we tend to use this
