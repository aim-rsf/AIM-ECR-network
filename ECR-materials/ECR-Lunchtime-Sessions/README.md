# About the sessions
This folder holds notes from the Early Career Researcher (ECR) Lunchtime Sessions hosted by the AIM RSF.

The AIM RSF is keen to create a regular informal, lively and supportive space for ECRs to meet üåª
By ECR here we mean PhD candidates, postdocs, research fellows, and junior infrastructure roles, e.g. data analysts, data scientists, data wranglers and software engineers.
These Lunchtime sessions provide a dedicated space for ECRs to participate in informal lunchtime talks, discussions, show-and-tells, or ‚Äòjust in time‚Äô training sessions to answer questions sent in advance.

üóìÔ∏è From September 2023, the ECR sessions are held on the last Wednesday of the month from 12:15 to 13:00 BST/GMT.

‚úçÔ∏è If you are an ECR and you'd like to present something, please [open up a new issue in this repository](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Event-Materials/issues/new) noting your preferred date and providing information on the topic you would like to present on/discuss.
