## Icebreaker

**What is your favourite thing about Autumn?** Add an emoji to represent it! ([emoji cheatsheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)).

- [name=Eirini] - Halloweeen :spider_web::skull:
- [name=Rachael] - the colours! :leaves: :fallen_leaf: :rainbow: 
- :shushing_face: - red and gold leaves :fallen_leaf: :maple_leaf:
- [name=Emilia] - autumn sunshine 
- [name=Sharmin] - no more heat waves! love the red color :leaves:
- :shushing_face: - colours :maple_leaf: 
- [name=Dave] - crisp air and cosy nights  
- [name=Susana] - squirrels gathering food - close enough emoji -> :chipmunk:
- [name=Cecilia] - :coffee:
- [name=Daniel] - :jack_o_lantern:

## :question: Questions
 
Post any questions that come up during the session here.

- [name=Dave] How does GitHub relate to use of data within Trusted Research Environments (TREs)?
- For me the commit thing was quite counterintuitive for a while! Today I had some discussions and the way we compared to making cake was useful! You first create some batter and you are ready to commit to this version of the batter-> you commit to it; you commit it. Then you decide you want to make two different versions, vanilla and chocolate batter - you branch the versions into different batters. Finally you want to merge them back together to make marble cake: you pull them together (you do a pull request).
- Is it useful to use university email rather than personal?
- So is the fork kind of like a template to use for something else?
- I guess when forking we need to look at licences? I always find this relatively confusing…🧐
