# Funding Guidelines

This document outlines the funding opportunities provided by the AIM RSF (Alan Turing Institute Research Support Facility ) for the Early Career Researcher (ECR) Day scheduled for **November 23, 2023,** at the Alan Turing Institute, British Library, London.

## Travel Expenses
**As part of the ECR Day arrangements, the RSF is pleased to offer a travel cost subsidy of up to £200 (inclusive of VAT) per ECR.**

The Turing can't arrange the travel for non-Turing staff directly. ECRs will have to arrange their own travel and request reimbursement via one of the methods below. All travel should be in compliance with [The Alan Turing Institute’s internal Travel and Expenses Policy](https://az659834.vo.msecnd.net/eventsairwesteuprod/production-uobevents-public/55742e599b004367b24d306d7ad73916).

There are two options for reimbursement:

- We encourage ECRs to purchase travel tickets through their internal institution system and for individual consortia to collate all travel expenses for their research group. A single collective claim using the three types of documents outlined below should be submitted to the RSF team for reimbursement. Consortia will need to fill them only once. RSF will then administer this to the value of £150 (maximum) for each consortium member travelling. 

- If the ECR is paying individually, each will need to submit individually by submitting three types of documents described below.

In exceptional circumstances, we are able to reimburse consortia through a Purchase Order if consortia internal systems prohibit the use the forms below. For this process, the AIM RSF (aimrsf@turing.ac.uk) will need to be notified by **14 September** to discuss the options.

In line with our commitment to sustainability, we strongly recommend selecting the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly means of travel. Delegates traveling by train should explore cost-saving options, such as utilizing existing travel cards and discounts. Claimants traveling by train must use standard class unless a cheaper fare in first class is available.

## Hotel Expenses
The RSF can arrange hotel accommodation for a maximum of one night if  requested in the registration form. Successful applicants to the Accessibility Fund can request an additional night's stay if required. 

## Accessibility Fund
We are delighted to offer an Accessibility Fund designed to support individuals with specific needs. This fund extends to a maximum of ten applicants, each eligible for financial assistance of up to £250. Examples of accessibility needs include (but are not limited to) childcare provision and/or an extra night's stay at a hotel due to caregiving responsibilities. To apply for the Accessibility Fund, it is essential to clearly articulate your specific  requirements and a compelling explanation of why these are necessary. This information enables us to tailor our support to ensure your experience is as comfortable and accessible as possible.  Receipts will be required for the funds to be provided.

Copy it and ensure all bank details are filled in, with the exception of the Name of the Turing Approver/Supervisor.

**_If you are sending the forms and receipts to the RSF team (aimrsf@turing.ac.uk) independently, rather than through your consortium project manager, please utilize DocuSign and complete all documents. You should have received an email from DocuSign containing all the necessary documents._**
