# ReproHack!
The afternoon part of this event will be a [ReproHack](https://www.reprohack.org/) ðŸ¤ž.
Eirini will open the session with an introduction to ReproHacks (what they are, why do them, how they work).
People will then self-assign to papers they'd like to reproduce.
The papers can be:
- [ReproHack papers](https://www.reprohack.org/paper/),
- papers that the participants have written, or
- other papers for which the data and code are available (incl. papers using data that the Turing can access through the UK Access Management Federation).

People can work alone or in small groups (small groups highly encouraged).
Papers normally get tagged with the analytical tool needed to reproduce the results, so people can work with tools they are comfortable with, but by working in pairs/groups they can also try to reproduce papers using tools they have less experience in.
