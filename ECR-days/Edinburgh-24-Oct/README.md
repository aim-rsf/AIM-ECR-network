**About**

From AIM-CISC, with the support of the AIM RSF, we are happy to host an Early Career Researcher (ECR) Day around the topic of Interdisciplinarity on the 24th of October 2024 at the Informatics Forum, University of Edinburgh.
In this event we will delve into
- what is interdisciplinary research,
- what institutional structures facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration,
- and what skills are needed for making cross-disciplinary collaborations effective.
As we all have a great deal of experience from our AIM projects on what working in an interdisciplinary project involves, we will also use the workshop to reflect and share the challenges, solutions, and lessons learned from it.

The event will be hybrid. We can host up to 30 in-person attendees, with budget to pay for travel (up to £200) and accommodation for up to 25 attendees. Registration can be done until the 12th of September [here](https://forms.gle/1fqM9RHPExLBodS69).

## Funding guidelines

**The workshop, accommodation, and transport (up to £200, inclusive of VAT) are fully funded.** The AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Research Support Facility can provide support with costs for travel and the AIM-CISC team will be organising accommodation (for a maximum of 1 night if requested in the registration form). There is also an accessibility fund which can support additional travel or other costs, to help facilitate attendance for those who may need it.

We can't arrange the travel directly, so ECRs will have to arrange their own travel and request reimbursement (within **2 weeks** after the event). All travel should be in compliance with [The Alan Turing Institute’s internal Travel and Expenses Policy](https://az659834.vo.msecnd.net/eventsairwesteuprod/production-uobevents-public/55742e599b004367b24d306d7ad73916).
