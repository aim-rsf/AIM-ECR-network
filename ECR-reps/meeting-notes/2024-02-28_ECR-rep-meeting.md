### Notes

- The ECR in-person day application: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMHUyzyWnGKl1FZQxAKR2vm_ghaA_5uq614IwzdlEyNbfvqw/viewform?usp=sf_link
- The ECR toolkit: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ejC45rLYS0TsH4373zbuS5spzzjaTilq7qIpRaYuEQ/edit#heading=h.wv1orbywdzw7
- Question about if it has to be hybrid or not.
    - hybrid will score higher in the rubric but we donâ€™t require all the ECR in-person events to be hybrid (if they can't).
- Date
    - date frame March to October.
    - AIM CISC is aiming for the end of Oct
    - We might need to change the date limit input in the application
- Ellie has suggested that the materials can be centralised in a single place. 
- It will be good to link to some instructions we have in the rubric
- Asra suggested creating a list of target audience questions to make it easier to select and fill in the form.
- Asra asked if anyone has any questions, they can get in touch with aimrsf@turing.ac.uk
- Comments in the toolkit include:
    - Add when the response will be received (in the planning section)
    - Asra suggested what role are expected in the event and how RSF is supporting
    - Batool asked what more documentation is needed to help folks who would like to integrate the event in bigger events (e.g. Bootcamp, conferences, ..etc). Emma suggested adding "what is the benefit of associating the ECR day in bigger event"
    - Sami suggested adding press kit (e.g. logos), making more clear that you can integrate the event into bigger events.
    - Guillermo: We are considering including a poster session as one of the main activities for our ECR Day, as it allows to have some structure while leaving flexibility for networking and talk about more focused topics. However, it's not easy to apply it to a hybrid format. 
        - Emma suggested using GatherTown which is good for posters or lightning talk (with timer) like 1 slide presentation.
- Emma mentioned doing training around working with PPIE as this was (as feedback) from AIM Conference 2023. The EIA form that we attached to the application is extremely useful.
    - Sami asked about having two webinars. One for PPIE and another for EDI?
    - Emma suggested having this training in one of the ECR in-person events
    - Guillermo mentioned that AIM CISC has people who support PPIE interaction and training
- Sami wilbe
