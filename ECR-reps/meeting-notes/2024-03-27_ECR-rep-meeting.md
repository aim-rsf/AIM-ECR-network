### Notes

**Feedback for Oxford's appolication.**

The event coincides with the RSF Conference and precedes the AIM conference by a few days. Spanning 4 days, requires a bit of a commitment, so the timing might be a bit tight. It is recommended that you share stories from past attendees, and highlighting the benefits of coming along, including some testimonials, would really help in getting people to apply and committee to the 4 days. Plus, it's good to point out that if people can only make it for the first few days, skipping the hackathon, that's totally fine. There also variety of potential attendees can be wide (e.g. patients, tech industry, research, clinicians etc.) so consideration needs to be given to how the information is 'pitched' to ensure it can reach and be understood by a wide audience â€“ although you might already have considered that. 


**Feedback for Liverpool's appolication**

ECR reps agree that the programme is well-developed programme with good theme and the only thing to flag is it's all presentations. Communication is so important and something we academics don't always do well. It's also great to see an event including PPIE. I'm not sure about the link between the speakers and theme of communication - could these be lunchtime talks instead? Also maybe include Public contributors as speaker.


**Feedback for Edinburgh's appolication**.

ECR reps have positive feedback â€“ they liked the hybrid element and inclusivity - they recommended that you use interdisciplinary research as a theme or look into a bit focused theme that doesn't overlap with the conference and previous events. You can focus on gathering feedback on what did and didn't work well and what we've learnt from these multidisciplinary projects. Perhaps a workshop on different themes/topics?. As this is the final event, it will include a lot of learnings from the 2 previous events. It could be beneficial for RSF to include a survey or any specific questions you'd like answered in the feedback forms for the Liverpool and Oxford events that can also help you shape your event more.
