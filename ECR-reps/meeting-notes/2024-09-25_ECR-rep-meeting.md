### Notes

    - Lucy: it was the 1st conference she attends, the format is good & interactive. DECODE work is wonderful. There were many important messages. We would love if there are a session about best practices between RCs.
    - Ellie: We brought some of our PPI members along to the conference, and it definitely highlighted to us, like, even within DECODE, where we have a learning disability nurse and a speech and language therapist.
    - Rafeal: catering was good,
